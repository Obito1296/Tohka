                      Tohka is a highly offensive fighter who uses a sword as her primary weapon. Aside from this, Tohka also has a large amount of "mana" within her Spirit body,
                       increasing her offensive and defensive abilities. You can place a powerful barrier around it, use energy blasts with your hands or fingers, and create shock waves with a simple arm movement.

                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <p>

                      His main weaponry is the <u>Sandalphon</u>, which takes on the appearance of a golden throne that doubles as the scabbard of his sword.
                        Tohka's fighting style mainly consists of strong and fast physical attacks with "mana" locking in her sword and body, or a high energy attack with her sword.

                  </p>
                  <br>

                  <p>

                      The throne itself appears to be a kind of support machine. Depending on how Tohka uses it, the throne can be turned into a transport ship by placing it horizontally.
                       By cutting the throne in half, you unlock the final form of his weapon; <Halvanhelev>, a huge single-edged sword shaped like a zanbatō that dramatically increases the destructive power of its Angel.

                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <p>

                      The resistance of Tohka's astral dress can withstand even a core explosion, since as seen in the anime she can resist space waves with her astral dress and space waves are worse than nucleus explosions.

                  <p>

                      Even when without her spirit mana, Tohka has displayed three abilities that can be considered supernatural.
                       The first is her incredible strength and speed, which, even when not enhanced by spirit mana, has proven to be far above that of an average human, breaking the record for girls at Raizen High School for a physical examination, while she was, in fact,
                        doing her best to contain herself. The second is the ability to instinctively sense if she is in danger, which was demonstrated when she was able to sense that she was being watched by the DEM, but could not feel anything when Ratatoskr, who had no intention of hurting her, was looking at her.
                         during his first battle with Ellen, he could instinctively sense that she was not an opponent he could resist.Finally, the third ability is an enhanced sense of smell, which he can use to easily locate or identify someone.

                      Later in the series, after Shido sealed Tohka's power, she is still able to regain some of her original power. At first this happened when her mental condition became unstable, however Tohka eventually learns to regain a fraction of her original power in the form of a Limited Release Ball Gown. During Volume 10,
                       Tohka was able to regain all of her powers, although she has not since, implying that she is still unable to regain all of her powers at will. Her limited astral dress adapts according to the outfit that Tohka is wearing at the time, be it the school uniform, casual clothes, a kimono, bathing suit and etc.
                        Even if it does not have the same resistance as its 100% astral dress, it also retains part of its power as it is also sealed.

                            After prolonged exposure to negative emotions when Shido was about to be killed, Tohka transforms into her other form, which,
                             according to Westcott, is her true form in the borderline dimension where she came from.

                            Tohka's general abilities in this state are similar to her Spirit form, but darker in color and nature.
                             In fact, according to Ratatoskr's Daily Observations, Tohka's offensive abilities in this form are even greater than in her spirit form,
                              but at the cost of reducing her defensive powers as compensation. However, despite this, Tohka was able to survive a point blank range attack used by Ellen and emerge unscathed.

                            His Demon King, Nahemah, is described as the opposite of his Angel, Sandalphon, who is a golden throne that stores a sword, rather than being a single-edged sword that remains separate from a dark gray-necked throne.
                             However, just like with Sandalphon, Tohka can destroy Nahemah's throne and add the shattered pieces to her sword to summon Paverschlev, a darker version of Halvanhelev. A single full-power swing from Paverschlev has proven to be strong enough to completely destroy a large portion of Tengu City and the mountains behind it,
                              as well as a large army of clones Kurumi and <Bandersnatch> in the process.

                            While in this form, Tohka has no recollection of her normal state and has shown no hesitation in killing anyone. Also, after returning to normal, Tohka has shown no recollection of what happened when she was in this form.

                            Tohka almost re-entered this state in Volume 10, when she had a mental breakdown because she lacked the power due to being sealed to protect the other sealed Spirits against Origami's attacks. Fortunately, Tohka did not transform, as she instinctively She realized that she was about to succumb to the dark power again within her,
                             knowing full well that relying on this power would not help her save anyone.

                              Durante la película, "Date A Live: Mayuri Judgement" , Tohka obtiene temporalmente el maná espiritual de todos los espíritus que Shido había sellado hasta ese momento.
                               Mientras está en este estado, gana un nuevo Vestido Astral que es una fusión de los suyos y de los otros espíritus. Además, también gana un nuevo Ángel llamado <u> Shekinah </u> , que, al igual que su propio Ángel <u> Sandalphon </u> , es un espadón.
                                También mantiene su capacidad de invocar a <u> Sandalphon </u> , lo que le permite empuñar a ambos Ángeles a la vez.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>

                            To describe the Tohka Spirit's ability in a few words, Tohka is a very offensive fighter who uses a sword as her primary weapon. Apart from this, Tohka also has large amount of "mana" in her spirit body that increases both offensive and defensive ability.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            His main weaponry is the Sandalphon, which takes on the appearance of a golden throne that functions as the sheath of his sword. His combat style consists primarily of either physical attacks with "mana" coating on the sword and body, or a high energy attack (such as a laser beam), combined with his sword.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The throne itself is a kind of aid machine, depending on how you use it. It can be changed into a transport ship by placing her horizontally, or to unlock the final form of her weapon, Halvanhelev, by cutting the throne into two exact halves. Later in the series, after she got her power sealed by Shido,
                             she manages to regain her power a bit from her during the Yoshino created crisis that threatens Shido.
